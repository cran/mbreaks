\arguments{
\item{y_name}{name of dependent variable in the data set}

\item{z_name}{name of independent variables in the data set which coefficients are allowed to change
across regimes. \code{default} is vector of 1 (Mean-shift model)}

\item{x_name}{name of independent variables in the data set which coefficients are constant across
regimes. \code{default} is \code{NULL}}

\item{data}{name of data set used}

\item{m}{Maximum number of structural changes allowed. If not specify,
m will be set to \code{default} value matching \code{eps1} input}

\item{eps}{convergence criterion for iterative recursive computation}

\item{eps1}{value of trimming (in percentage) for the construction
and critical values. Minimal segment length \code{h} will be set
at \code{default} = int(\code{eps1}*T) (T is total sample size).
\itemize{
\item
\item{\code{eps1=0.05} Maximal value of \code{m} = 10}
\item{\code{eps1=0.10} Maximal value of \code{m} = 8}
\item{\code{eps1=.15} Maximal value of \code{m} = 5}
\item{\code{eps1=.20} Maximal value of \code{m} = 3}
\item{\code{eps1=.25} Maximal value of \code{m} = 2}
\item{\code{eps1=0} This option is not allowed}}}

\item{maxi}{maximum number of iterations}

\item{fixb}{option to use fixed initial input \eqn{\beta}. If \code{1},
the model will use values given in \code{betaini}. If \code{0}, betaini is skipped}

\item{betaini}{Initial \eqn{beta_0} to use in estimation}

\item{printd}{Print option for model estimation. \code{default} = 0, to
suppress intermediate outputs printing to console}

\item{prewhit}{set to \code{1} to apply AR(1) prewhitening prior to estimating
the long run covariance matrix.}

\item{robust}{set to \code{1} to allow for heterogeneity
and autocorrelation in the residuals, \code{0} otherwise.
The method used is \emph{Andrews(1991)} automatic bandwidth with AR(1) approximation with quadratic
kernel. Note: Do not set to \code{1} if lagged dependent variables are
included as regressors.}

\item{hetdat}{option for the construction of the F tests. Set to 1 if want to
allow different moment matrices of the regressors across segments.
If \code{hetdat} = \code{0}, the same moment matrices are assumed for each segment
and estimated from the ful sample. It is recommended to set
\code{hetdat}=\code{1} if number of regressors \code{x} > \code{0}.}

\item{hetvar}{option for the construction of the F tests.Set to \code{1}
if users want to allow for the variance of the residuals to be different across segments.
If \code{hetvar}=\code{0}, the variance of the residuals is assumed constant
across segments and constructed from the full sample. \code{hetvar}=\code{1} when \code{robust} =\code{1})}

\item{const}{indicates whether the regression model include an
intercept changing across regimes. Default value is 1}

\item{signif}{significance level used to sequential test to select number of breaks.
\itemize{
\item 4: 1\% level
\item 3: 2.5\% level
\item 2: 5\% level
\item 1: 10\% level

\description{
\code{dorepart()} computes the repartition estimates of the breaks obtained
by the sequential method by Bai, 1995.. It alows estimates that have the same asymptotic
distribution as those obtained by global minimization. Otherwise, the
output from the procedure "estim" below do not deliver asymptotically
correct confidence intervals for the break dates.
