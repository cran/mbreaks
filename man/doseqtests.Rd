\arguments{
\item{y_name}{name of dependent variable in the data set}

\item{z_name}{name of independent variables in the data set which coefficients are allowed to change
across regimes. \code{default} is vector of 1 (Mean-shift model)}

\item{x_name}{name of independent variables in the data set which coefficients are constant across
regimes. \code{default} is \code{NULL}}

\item{data}{name of data set used}

\item{m}{maximum number of breaks}

\item{eps}{convergence criterion for recursive calculations (For partial change model ONLY)}

\item{eps1}{value of trimming (in percentage) for the construction
and critical values. Minimal segment length \code{h} will be set
at \code{default} = int(\code{eps1}*T) (T is total sample size).
There are five options:
\itemize{
\item{\code{eps1=0.05} Maximal value of \code{m} = 10}
\item{\code{eps1=0.10} Maximal value of \code{m} = 8}
\item{\code{eps1=.15} Maximal value of \code{m} = 5}
\item{\code{eps1=.20} Maximal value of \code{m} = 3}
\item{\code{eps1=.25} Maximal value of \code{m} = 2}
\item{\code{eps1=0} is not allowed. The test is undefined for no trimming level}
}}

\item{maxi}{number of maximum iterations for recursive calculations of finding
global minimizers.\code{default} = 10 (For partial change model ONLY)}

\item{fixb}{option to use fixed initial input \eqn{\beta}. If \code{1},
the model will use values given in \code{betaini}. If \code{0}, betaini is skipped}

\item{betaini}{Initial \eqn{beta_0} to use in estimation (Must be a \verb{p x 1} matrix, where p is number of x variables)}

\item{printd}{Print option for model estimation. \code{default} = 0, to
suppress intermediate outputs printing to console}

\item{prewhit}{set to \code{1} to apply AR(1) prewhitening prior to estimating
the long run covariance matrix.}

\item{robust}{set to \code{1} to allow for heterogeneity
and autocorrelation in the residuals, \code{0} otherwise.
The method used is \emph{Andrews(1991)} automatic bandwidth with AR(1) approximation with quadratic
kernel. Note: Do not set to \code{1} if lagged dependent variables are
included as regressors.}

\item{hetdat}{option for the construction of the F tests. Set to 1 if want to
allow different moment matrices of the regressors across segments.
If \code{hetdat} = \code{0}, the same moment matrices are assumed for each segment
and estimated from the ful sample. It is recommended to set
\code{hetdat}=\code{1} if number of regressors \code{x} > \code{0}.}

\item{hetvar}{option for the construction of the F tests.Set to \code{1}
if users want to allow for the variance of the residuals to be different across segments.
If \code{hetvar}=\code{0}, the variance of the residuals is assumed constant
across segments and constructed from the full sample. \code{hetvar}=\code{1} when \code{robust} =\code{1})}

\item{hetq}{used in the construction of the confidence intervals for the break
dates. If \code{hetq}=\code{0}, the moment matrix of the data is assumed identical
across segments}

\item{hetomega}{used in the construction of the confidence intervals for the break
dates. If \code{hetomega}=\code{0}, the long run covariance matrix of zu is
assumed identical across segments
(the variance of the errors u if \code{robust}={0})}

\item{const}{indicates whether the regression model include an
intercept changing across regimes. Default value is 1}
}
\value{
A list that contains following:
\itemize{
\item{supfl: SupF(l+1|l) test statistics}
\item{cv: Critical values for SupF(l+1|l) test}}
}
\description{
\code{doseqtests()} computes the sequential sup F tests of l versus l+1 for l from
1 to m with each corresponding null hypothesis of maximum number of break is l
and alternative hypothesis is l+1. The l breaks under the null hypothesis
are taken from the global minimization estimation
