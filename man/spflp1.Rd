\description{
Function computes the test statistics of supF(l+1|l) test with null hypothesis
is l=\code{nseg}-1 and alternative hypothesis is l+1.
The l breaks under the null hypothesis are taken from the global minimization.

\code{spflp1} computes the test statistics of supF(l+1|l) test with null hypothesis
is l=\code{nseg-1} and alternative hypothesis is l+1.
